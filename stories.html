      <p>
        A Lot of people say that they can help and that they know how you feel. But the truth is they really don't, not unless they have gone through it themselves. Even then though all events that bullying occurs is different.
<br>
<br>
Everyone says just tell a teacher or somebody that can help but i know from experience that it isn't that easy. But i can also tell you from experience that you need to find someone, anyone who you can trust and tell things to. This person also needs to be supportive and won't break down under pressure. You should be able to tell all your worries onto this person without making fun of you and leaving themselves.
<br>
<br>
If you do tell the teacher you must tell the right one if you want it to stop. Telling the wrong teacher could backfire onto. For example once i got physically bullied and I ended up with the detention and the people who assaulted me got rewards from the same teacher the very next day. You must find a teacher that will take action into their own hands and will stop the bullying at the root. If the kid or kids gets a detention and has to stay in for what half of lunch, this will not help things. This will only escalate the bullying.

In my own experiences I have been bullied in many ways, through a video game, online, most commonly verbally but the most recent bullying was physical. Here is how my story goes
<br>
<br>
“My story started out in kindergarten. All the kids in my class would call me names, and make fun of me. At first I took it as teasing, but as I grew up, I realized that for some reason… everyone hated me. I didn’t know why and frankly, I wanted it to stop, badly. During primary school it luckily never escalated through to physical bullying. These kids would torment me and when I went home looking sad for what they had done that day, I would say that I was tired but I think that my parents always knew that something was on. This just kept happening until late 5th grade when I was tormented on a really large scale. Luckily, an old friend came to me and cheered me up. For the rest of the year and the first semester of 6th grade I would hang out with him. Unfortunately, my friend was in the year below me so I had to try and make friends with these people, it started off a little rough but as they hadn’t done anything for a for 6 months they didn’t do anything.
7th grade came fast and I lost my friend so I had to make new ones. I was never good at this and unfortunately the bullies split up into groups and spread rumours about me so it was hard to find friends. So I ended up making friends with the other loners and there was quite a few and we made a group of our own. Nothing happened until the time that I left the rugby league team to focus on soccer when there was this absolute midget who would always hit me. I got really annoyed and caught his fist. That day just as school ended the midget came up to me and tried to start a fight. His other midget friends came up behind him and pulled him back. Ever since then nothing has happened. But just recently some random kid who I had never spoken with and who hadn’t done anything to me before came up behind me and slammed my head against a brick wall. After this he just walked away and everybody just looked as I sat there.  All my friends were already inside and so I washing rushing in to meet with them when that happened. Being a loner at school where everybody hates your guts does not help at all. Gladly everything has stopped since then.”

Here are some other stories that have been anonymously been tipped into us.
 <br>
 <br>
“I always thought that life was about chasing my dreams. That changed when I was in the 6th grade it was the best experience of my life until people got in their groups and everything and everyone had a label sadly I was labeled the target in my grade people always calling me names, pushing me, but mostly spreading untrue things about me. It was pretty heartbreaking when that happened, my most trusted friends didn’t even like me because they didn’t want to become the target. 7th and 8th grade came and it was mostly name calling but nothing out of the usual. It was my freshman year when things got physical and it brought me down. I fought it for a bit but, enough was enough I stopped coming to school or I would never finish the day. But after a while I finally told my secret to a trusted friend that I was gay. she broke that promise, word got out but now because I have friends that care I get help from the teachers I trust and it’s working steadily. I just have one thing to say….” never let your key of happiness end up in someone’s pocket.”

“Me being bullied was terrible! I got picked on every day! Even my friends bullied me! When I moved back to my hometown, I was really happy but when people saw me with just one glance, they picked on me. I didn’t tell a single soul, not even to my older sister who is trusting. When I got into the fifth grade, it got really worse. It got that bad that I became very depressed. My older sister soon figured it out when I got in the sixth grade.  So I finally told my older sister everything that had been going on. Soon, I moved to a new place and it’s filled with very kind people. My new friends don’t pick on me, everyone is kind, teachers listen, and I smile for real now. If it wasn’t for the friends, I would be dead by now from suicide. What I really want to do is get everyone to open up from being bullied. I’m a very kind person but also very quiet so whenever people need help I gladly help them. And also, during the time I was being bullied, a lot of YouTubers helped me through it. One told me I’m an awesome person and I’m important. Which now I have found true. I used to lock myself away, that was until I found my place in the world. And that place is with people, my friends families, and school. This is the story of a girl who managed to get through it all.”
