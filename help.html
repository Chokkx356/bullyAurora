      <p>
        Are you being bullied? Are people constantly harassing you? Are people mentally abusing you? Are people starting rumours? Are you not game to go on social media? Are you scared to show yourself? If you answered yes to any of these questions you need immediate support. Immediate support can come from anyone you trust. It could be your best friend, a close teacher, a parent or another family member. There are also people outside you direct family and friends that can help you. Counsellors are another easy point of contact, they can offer you support and help you with methods of avoidance. Counselling can remain completely confidential, and once you’re over 15 years of age you can choose to go without your parents.

If you don’t want to face anyone about your troubles there is also the online chat rooms and helplines. These can stay anonymous if you choose and allow you a confidential space to talk about your troubles. Websites like beyond blue offer supportive reading materials and helplines.
